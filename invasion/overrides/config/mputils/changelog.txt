									§41.0.6 Changelog
* Quest fixes and editing may have a possibility of clearing your current quest progress. To fix this issue: Use the command "/hqm edit" in-game and shift-click and finished quests to resume your progress								
* §6Removed the wither teleport ability
* Added the Level Up mod to allow players to use XP towards various skills
* §6Actually fixed the MKII generators to not use dragon's breath!
* Many existing structures have been edited to fit more naturally into the environment and a TON of new structures have been added to the worldgen
* §6The Mob Masher now actually works! It was a conflict with the levels mod!
* The saga of editing Voxel prices continues! ID changes caused some items to have a much, much, much lower value than I intended for them. They are now properly adjusted. Also! I fixed another exploit! /me adds a check to the wall
* §6Changed the way Cyberware upgrades act on player death. When the player dies, Cyberware upgrades are dropped on the ground and the player respawns with no upgrades. The reason behind this was, players would permanently cause blindness or lose an arm which would end their world. Now, you won't necessarily lose your stuff as long as you run back and pick it up within 5 minutes or it SHOULD spawn in your grave, too. Yes, I know this allows you to get 2 of an upgrade, but I'd rather have that than end a world (This only affects new worlds you have to run the "/gamerule cyberware_dropCyberware true" and "/gamerule cyberware_keepCyberware false")
* Added the "Suspended Server" mod to stop servers from continuing progress when no one is online (Server Side Only)

* §6Added Xnet for piping/cable options
* Added a recipe to get Spider Eyes from Camel Spiders, found in Sand
* §6Removed the SoulBound enchant, due to a conflict with the Levels mod, on death, Soulbound items using an Enchantment Table/Anvil would be deleted. So, You technically never had Soulbound and should be thanking me for saving your items. Also, any items currently in your world with Soulbound will not be deleted. The Bagginses mod has its own Soulbound enchant that will persist through an update, but won't let you craft any more. Iron Backpack eternity upgrades are still usable and will persist through death. The Levels mod has its own Soulbound enchant that you can buy with enough experience levels, this SHOULD work correctly
* Glass Bottles will no longer pickup infinite amounts from a flowing source, and should not pickup from non-water sources
* §6Added the Scannable mod. It allows the player to use a scanner to find blocks, enemies, friendly animals, etc. in the world. They are obtainable as rare loot in Drop Beacons

* §6Finally managed to remove the Advanced Rocketry plate presser recipes to avoid confusion for the player

* §6Added a recipe for the Progressive Automation Cobblegen using Clay Buckets
* Digging Raiders are now pushed back to day 16, They will have diamond tools on day 24, and tnt on day 32

									§41.0.3 Changelog
* §6Raiders, Animals, Drones, and Laser Creeper mod mobs should now obey vanilla-like lighting and not spawn in your base any longer. This also marks an entire overhaul to the mob spawning system. We discovered a bug introduced to the pack before public release 1.0 that took some time for the developers to go through, identify, fix, and then make it consistent across all the mods spawning custom mobs. You should not see hordes of enemies that were in previous versions. 
* Laser Creeper weapons now do more damage when used by the player
* §6Ranged Pump now requires energy to run
* Raiders health increase on difficulty increases is slightly lowered, they should have less health as the levels increase. They will also max out on health on difficulty level 6, this should cap their health off at around 70HP on average (You'll still see the occasional high health raider)

* Added a recipe for a Witch Soul Vial, allowing the player to obtain the Inventory Panel
* §6Player Drone health has been increased from 15 to 20

* §6Added a recipe to convert Red Sandstone to 4 Red Sand
* Removed the easy Steel recipe

* Added a number of metal rods to the Rod Ore Dictionary lists, should now allow any type of metal rods to be used in most recipes

* The quest requiring a holo-projector should now turn in even after selecting a structure
* §6Lowered the total amount of many Crafting Tasks in the Quest book due to Shift-Clicking only recognizing 1 item if the crafting operation resulted in multiple outputs
* Added a few crafting recipes to turn Quartz Blocks into Quartz using Ex Nihilo Hammers
* §6Rice Slimeballs are once again craftable, enjoy! This is your one change that adds a little tiny bit of fun. BUT THAT'S ALL YOU GET!
* Because of the previously mentioned change, Duct Tape now takes an act of god to craft. Yay! Fun removed!
* §6Fixed Fruit Juice to now require a glass bottle, because how will you drink liquid if it's not in a container?!
* Turned on Cyberware parts persisting through death
* §6WTF Cave Expedition has been split into two separate mods: Gravity and other gameplay tweaks exist in its own mod now. The random occurance of players logging in and seeing ice and sand blocks in their bases or already generated terrain should not happen any longer. World loading should be a bit faster due to optimizations to these mods.
* HQM has added a fix to the Soulbound death loop issue, this should not occur any longer. There's also a fix for a multiplayer server to use the correct locations for questing data

This should fix issues servers were having when setting the time backwards and mobs were spawning before the correct time
* Emerald Armor from Actually Additions has been added back to the pack, you can also upgrade it to Emeradic Armor using the Atomic Reconstructor
* §6Increased the damage of Immersive Engineering projectile weapons
* The Rope Bridge mod will no longer Zoom in other player's screens on servers
